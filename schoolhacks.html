	<title>Amazing school hacks</title>
<p>	1)Instead of using google.com for essay’s use scholar.google.com which will help you find more information easier.
2) You want to study but you don’t know what are the best times to study?

3) Writing down your worries before a test has been proven to improve your test scores.
4) You’re 50% more likely to remember something if you speak it out loud instead of reading it over and over again.
5) Not enough words in your essay? Just add random words and turn them white. That way your teacher won’t be able to see them and I don’t think they will check every word count.
