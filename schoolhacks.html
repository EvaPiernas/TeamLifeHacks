	<title>Amazing school hacks</title>
<ul>	
<li>1)Instead of using google.com for essay’s use scholar.google.com which will help you find more information easier.
<li>2) You want to study but you don’t know what are the best times to study?

<li>3) Writing down your worries before a test has been proven to improve your test scores.
<li>4) You’re 50% more likely to remember something if you speak it out loud instead of reading it over and over again.
<li>5) Not enough words in your essay? Just add random words and turn them white. That way your teacher won’t be able to see them and I don’t think they will check every word count.
