	<title>Amazing school hacks</title>
<ol>	
<li>Instead of using google.com for essays, use scholar.google.com.  This will help you find information more easily.
<li>You want to study but you don’t know when the best times are to study? (pic here)
<li>Writing down your worries before a test has been proven to improve your test scores.
<li>You’re 50% more likely to remember something if you speak it out loud instead of reading it over and over again.
<li>Not enough words in your essay? Just add random words and turn them white. That way your teacher won’t be able to see them and I don’t think they will check every word count.
