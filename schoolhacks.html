<li>Instead of using google.com for &#39;s use scholar.google.com which will help you find more information easier.
<li> You want to study but you don&#39;t know what are the best times to study?</li>

<li> Writing down your worries before a test has been proven to improve your test scores.</li>
<li> You&#39;re 50% more likely to remember something if you speak it out loud instead of reading it over and over again.</li>
<li>Not enough words in your essay? Just add random words and turn them white. That way your teacher won&#39;t be able to see them and I don&#39;t think they will check every word count.</li>
